An Open Source Third-Party Client for the Old School RuneScape Steam Client.

## About
With the ever-growing hints that Jagex will be discontinuing the Java client for 
Old School RuneScape in favor of their Steam NXT based native client, this puts all current
third-party clients with quality of life improvements on a doomsday clock.

When Jagex decides to drop support for Java, all current clients like RSBuddy and RuneLite will
not work. And worse, there is no way to "Make them Work". All plugins, client, etc. Will need to
be re-coded completely either in C++ or some other native compatible language.

I've decided to jump on this train early and start development to make a forever fully
open source client and plugin api targeting the OSRS NXT Steam client to hopefully
pave the way for others to follow.

## Roadmap
This project is still heavily under development and has no set release date or 
even any milestone plans yet. Once the project progresses, I will update this section.
